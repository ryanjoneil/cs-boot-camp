Preface
=======

In this book you will find a series of exercises intended for quickly developing or refreshing basic Computer Science skills. It is not intended to be exhaustive on any one subject, but more of a broad covering of important topics from an undergraduate curriculum.

Each chapter contains a number of exercises and solutions. The solution code is availble through two directories in the GitHub repository for this book.

- [github.com/ryanjoneil/cs-boot-camp/csbc-bin](https://github.com/ryanjoneil/cs-boot-camp/tree/master/csbc-bin)
- [github.com/ryanjoneil/cs-boot-camp/csbc-lib](https://github.com/ryanjoneil/cs-boot-camp/tree/master/csbc-lib)

The former contains reference solutions for the exercises written in the language Go (.go files). The latter contains data structures used by some of the exercises. You should write your data structures and solutions in whatever language you like, then compare to the reference implementations.
